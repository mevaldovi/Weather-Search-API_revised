# Agknowledgments
A huge thank you to classmates [Carlos Perez](https://github.com/cperezba), [Jessamyn McTwigan](https://github.com/jessamyn27), and [Jacob Guiro](https://github.com/Jguiro09) for guiding me through where I got stuck and for letting me use some of their javascript code to get it up and running. Shoutout to Jacob for letting me use his UI design and funcionality code.

"Last, but not least, I would like to thank me. I want to thank me for believing in me, I want to thank me for doing all this hard work. I wanna thank me for having no days off. I wanna thank me for never quitting. I wanna thank me for always been a giver and trying to give more than I receive. I want to thank me for trying to do more right than wrong. I want to thank me for just being me at all times.‚Äù --Snoop Dog
